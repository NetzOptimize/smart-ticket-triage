## Usage

3. View and manage tickets in the ticket list
4. Use the search and filter options to find specific tickets
5. Click "Classify" on unclassified tickets to use AI classification

### Bulk Classification

The application includes a command-line tool for bulk classification of tickets using job queues. This is useful for processing large numbers of tickets efficiently.

To use bulk classification:

1. Start the queue worker:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

2. Run the bulk classification command:
```bash
# Basic usage (process up to 100 tickets)
php artisan tickets:bulk-classify

# Process a specific number of tickets
php artisan tickets:bulk-classify --limit=50

# Process tickets with a specific status
php artisan tickets:bulk-classify --status=open

# Customize chunk size for better performance
php artisan tickets:bulk-classify --chunk=20

# Combine options
php artisan tickets:bulk-classify --status=open --limit=200 --chunk=25
```

Command Options:
- `--status`: Filter tickets by status (default: open)
- `--limit`: Maximum number of tickets to process (default: 100)
- `--chunk`: Number of tickets to process in each chunk (default: 10)
